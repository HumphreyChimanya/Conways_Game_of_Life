ðŸ§¬ Conway's Game of Life â€“ A Cellular Automaton Simulation in Python

Conway's Game of Life is a zero-player game developed by mathematician John Conway. It's a simple simulation that models how patterns evolve over time based on a set of rules. The entire "game" unfolds on a 2D grid of cells, where each cell is either alive or dead.
